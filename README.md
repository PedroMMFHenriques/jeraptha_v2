## Introduction

Welcome to Jeraptha_V2, a Discord bot that adds a virtual economy to your server! You can make wagers with other users, play fun games to earn more coins and use your coins to buy rewards.

Players will need to guess a word from a dictionary database. With each guess, the correct letters and positions will be displayed to the user in order to help find the selected word.

The first word of the day is the same for every user in the server, and it's worth extra coins. The bot tracks correct answers and maintains a leaderboard.

## Database and Data Handling

This bot uses a database to manage game data, user statistics, and server-specific settings. Here's how the data is structured and how you can set it up:

### 1. **Database Type**
- The bot uses [SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL] for data persistence. You can change the database type in the configuration file if needed.

### 2. **Data Stored**
- **User Data**: Stores user IDs, usernames, and game statistics like wins, losses, and leaderboards.
- **Game Data**: Tracks ongoing games, such as current game state, player turns, and scores.
- **Server Settings**: Each server can have customized settings like command prefixes and bot behavior.

### 3. **Database Setup**

1. **For SQLite** (default):
    - The bot will automatically create an `sqlite.db` file in the root directory to store data.
    - No additional setup is required unless you want to change the database type.

2. **For MySQL/PostgreSQL**:
    - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

    ```env
    DB_TYPE=mysql
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    DB_NAME=yourbotdb
    ```

    - Ensure your MySQL/PostgreSQL server is running and the database is created.

3. **Migrations**:
    - The bot comes with built-in migrations to set up the necessary tables. Run:

    ```bash
    npm run migrate  # For Node.js
    # or
    python manage.py migrate  # For Python
    ```

4. **Backup and Restore**:
    - For backup, export the database to a `.sql` or `.db` file.
    - For restoring, import the file back into your database server.
