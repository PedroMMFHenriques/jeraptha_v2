## Database and Data Handling

This bot uses a database to manage game data, user statistics, and server-specific settings. Here's how the data is structured and how you can set it up:

### 1. **Database Type**
- The bot uses [SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL] for data persistence. You can change the database type in the configuration file if needed.

### 2. **Data Stored**
- **User Data**: Stores user IDs, usernames, and game statistics like wins, losses, and leaderboards.
- **Game Data**: Tracks ongoing games, such as current game state, player turns, and scores.
- **Server Settings**: Each server can have customized settings like command prefixes and bot behavior.

### 3. **Database Setup**

1. **For SQLite** (default):
    - The bot will automatically create an `sqlite.db` file in the root directory to store data.
    - No additional setup is required unless you want to change the database type.

2. **For MySQL/PostgreSQL**:
    - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

    ```env
    DB_TYPE=mysql
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    DB_NAME=yourbotdb
    ```

    - Ensure your MySQL/PostgreSQL server is running and the database is created.

3. **Migrations**:
    - The bot comes with built-in migrations to set up the necessary tables. Run:

    ```bash
    npm run migrate  # For Node.js
    # or
    python manage.py migrate  # For Python
    ```

4. **Backup and Restore**:
    - For backup, export the database to a `.sql` or `.db` file.
    - For restoring, import the file back into your database server.
